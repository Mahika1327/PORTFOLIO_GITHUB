# Technology Used
➢ HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML was used to structure the content of the website. It provides the basic framework for organizing text, images,links, and other elements, making sure it is clear and accessible.

➢ CSS was for adding stylizing elements on the visual look of the website: Styling means things like fonts, color, space, and responsiveness characteristics of a website.

➢ Version Control or Git was used in developing versions for easy tracking of changes made, collaborating in any files, and, in general, controlling and managing the project according to the stages it developed within the course.

➢ Code Editor: Used for writing/typing in the HTML/CSS code; in the case, Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text used, along with syntax coloring and all the other aids to making coding easier to do.

These technologies above were going to be built into creating a professional as well as functional student portfolio website to be an excellent demonstration of skills and projects
